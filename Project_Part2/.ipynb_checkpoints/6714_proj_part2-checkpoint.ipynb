Alija Izetbegovic, whom he met during a Friday visit.\\n But the radio report did not specify what guarantees, if any, the U.S. envoy had provided.\\n Absentee voting in the elections began on Wednesday, August 28 and runs for a week.\\n Election day for those living inside Bosnia is September 14.\\n The Party of Democratic Action ( SDA ) had called on Wednesday for its followers abroad to boycott the absentee balloting because of voter registration irregularities, especially among Serb refugees.\\n The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) postponed municipal elections as a result of the irregularities but decided to proceed with voting for higher offices.\\n The SDA, joined by two other parties, has been demanding that OSCE prohibit refugees voting from

win and offer millionaire backer Nigel Wray an early return on his big investment in the north London club.\\n French centre Philippe Sella also enjoyed a good game alongside Lynagh, although the home

their side's 75-19 victory over Gloucester.\\n Former England captain Will Carling, handed the kicking duties, finished with 20 points.\\n With the first day of the league season briefly shifting the

forget that the OSCE only has limited powers there, \" said Cotti, who is also the Swiss foreign minister. \"\\n Our mission in Chechnya has done all it can within the given limitations. \"\\n Pro-Moscow leaders in Chechnya have criticised Tim Guldimann, the Swiss diplomat who heads the OSCE Chechnya mission, saying he was biased toward Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, president of the self-declared separatist government.\\n Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and Chechen separatist military leader Aslan Maskhadov started a new round of peace talks on Friday just outside the rebel region.\\n Cotti said Chechnya must remain part of Russia, but the solution to the conflict would be to accord the region maximum autonomy within Russia\\'s borders.\\n \" There is no doubt that Chechnya, according to OSCE principles, belongs to a state called Russia, \" he said, pointing out that Russia was an OSCE member and it was not the organisation\\'s policy to challenge members \\' sovereignty.\\n He added that the OSCE was the only international body which has been allowed into the Chechnya to monitor the human rights situation there, but that its means were restricted by the fact that the conflict was

Commerce Department said Friday, as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months.\\n Spending rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June.\\n Incomes from wages, salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June.\\n Department officials said July\\'s slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since January, when they were flat.\\n Wages and salaries came under pressure in July as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks.\\n The department said wages and salaries decreased by $ 6.9 billion in July after climbing $ 45 billion in June.\\n \" In July, average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined, more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment, \" Commerce said.\\n But more money went into savings accounts, as savings held at 5.3 cents out of each dollar earned in both June and July.\\n That was the highest savings rate since October last year, when 5.5 cents out of each dollar earned was being saved.\\n The generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in July had been expected.\\n At the same time, the department said in a separate report that new orders received by U.S. factories climbed strongly in July, with widespread gains across most major categories.\\n Orders increased 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion, significantly stronger than the 1 percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists.\\n That followed a revised 0.7 percent decline in June orders.\\n Commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only 0.1 percent in July, partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks.\\n In addition, the Labour Department\\'s July employment report had foreshadowed the muted income growth.\\n It showed average hourly earnings fell in July by 0.2 percent to $ 11.00 and the average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.7 in June.\\n Gains in personal income, which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends, interest and businesses, are essential for funding consumer purchases, which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity.\\n Spending on all types of durable goods, which includes cars, fell to an annual rate of $ 626.3 billion in July from $ 633.6 billion in June.\\n But spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of $ 1.55 trillion from $ 1.54 trillion in June, while spending for services was up to $ 2.97 trillion in July from $ 2.96 trillion.\\n Payrolls of manufacturing companies rose in July by $ 2.3 billion to an annual rate of $ 678 billion.\\n ', '79_Seven': 'Seven Iraqis charged with

hearing.\\n They were accused of taking over Flight 150 which was flying from Khartoum, Sudan, to Amman, Jordan.\\n All the hostages were freed on Tuesday after the plane landed at Stansted airport, north of London.\\n The men have claimed political asylum in Britain saying they were persecuted while in Iraq.\\n Their court appearance means they will face trial and possible imprisonment in Britain before their applications for asylum are considered.\\n Under English law the maximum sentence for hijack is life imprisonment but there has been widespread speculation that the seven will receive lesser sentences.\\n After a search of the aircraft following the hijack, police found only knives and fake explosives.\\n ', '90_Chinese': 'Chinese police hold veteran dissident.\\n BEIJING

province of Zhejiang, told Wang\\'s family that Wang would be sent to a study class, a euphemism for coercive ideological reform, the group said.\\n Police gave no reason for detaining Wang on Friday and would not let his family meet him or say where he was being held, the group said.\\n Police also would not say why Wang was being sent to a study class -- a holdover from the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution -- or say when he would be released, the group said.\\n Wang\\'s family and Hangzhou police could not be reached for immediate comment.\\n The group demanded Wang\\'s release and said his detention was a dangerous signal China was returning to its Cultural Revolution days.\\n Last month, Wang, 45, a veteran dissident of the 1979 Democracy Wall movement, was ordered to serve one year of \" re-education through labour \", but released because of poor health.\\n Re-education through labour is an administrative punishment with a maximum of three years that can be imposed by police without recourse to prosecutors or the courts.\\n Wang was jailed for two years for organising street protests after the military crushed pro-democracy demonstrations by students at Beijing\\'s Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, with heavy loss of life.\\n Chinese authorities appeared to be using administrative punishment more frequently to take dissidents out of circulation without having to
